<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>A knitted R Markdown document (as a PDF) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on 11/24/2019. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document). Knit an html copy too, for later! In the .Rmd file for Project 2, you can copy the first code-chunk into your project .Rmd file to get better formatting. Notice that you can adjust the opts_chunk$set(…) above to set certain parameters if necessary to make the knitting cleaner (you can globally set the size of all plots, etc). I have gone ahead and set a few for you (such as disabling warnings and package-loading messges when knitting)!</p>
<p>Like before, I envision your written text forming something of a narrative structure around your code/output. All results presented must have corresponding code. Any answers/results/plots etc. given without the corresponding R code that generated the result will not be graded. Furthermore, all code contained in your final project document should work properly. Please do not include any extraneous code or code which produces error messages. (Code which produces warnings is acceptable, as long as you understand what the warnings mean).</p>
</div>
<div id="find-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Find data:</h2>
<p>Find one dataset with at least 5 variables that wish to use to build model. At least one should be categorical (with 2-5 groups) and at least two should be numeric. Ideally, one of your variables will be binary (if not, you will need to create one by discretizing a numeric, which is workable but less than ideal). You will need a minimum of 40 observations (<em>at least</em> 10 observations for every explanatory variable you have, ideally 20+ observations/variable).</p>
<p>It is perfectly fine to use either dataset (or the merged dataset, or a subset of your variables) from Project 1. However, you could also diversify your portfolio a bit by choosing a different dataset to work with (particularly if the variables did not reveal interesting associations in Project 1). The only requirement/restriction is that you may not use data from any examples we have done in class or lab. It would be a good idea to pick more cohesive data this time around (i.e., variables that you actually thing might have a relationship you would want to test). Think more along the lines of your Biostats project.</p>
<p>Again, you can use data from anywhere you want (see bottom for resources)! If you want a quick way to see whether a built-in (R) dataset has binary and/or character (i.e., categorical) variables, check out this list: <a href="https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html" class="uri">https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>This data was found on kaggle and it is about the download information from google play store apps. Each app is an obervation, and we have many variables included, but we mainly focusing on the category, rating, reviews, size and type variables. The categroy indicates which category the app belongs, the rating is the overall user rating of the app when this data was collected, the reviews is the number of user review for the app, the size is just the size of the app for downloading, and type is a binary variable that represents either its a free app or a paid app. </em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1. (15 pts)</strong> Perform a MANOVA testing whether any of your numeric variables (or a subset of them, if including them all doesn’t make sense) show a mean difference across levels of one of your categorical variables (3). If they do, perform univariate ANOVAs to find response(s) showing a mean difference across groups (3), and perform post-hoc t tests to find which groups differ (3). Discuss the number of tests you have performed, calculate the probability of at least one type I error (if unadjusted), and adjust the significance level accordingly (bonferroni correction) before discussing significant differences (3). Briefly discuss assumptions and whether or not they are likely to have been met (2).</li>

<p><em>A MANOVA was conducted to dertermine the effect of the Category(GAME, MEDICAL, SPORTS) on two independent variables(Reviews and Size). Signifcant results were found among the three categories of app on the two independent measures, with a p &lt; 0.0001. Univariate analyses of variance for each independent variable were conducted as follow-up test to the MANOVA, first without any p-value adjustment, and both ANOVA tests returned significant results, with p &lt; 0.0001, which means there is at least one mean difference in Reviews and Size. Post hoc analysis was performed conducting pairwise comparisons to determine which category differed in Reviews and Size. Except for the Medical/Sports group, all other categroies were found to differ significantly from each other in terms of Reviews and Size after adjusting for the p-value. A total numebr of 9 tests were conducted, including 1 MANOVA, 2 ANOVA and 6 pair wise t-tests, and the corresponding probability for at least one type I error is 0.0056. As for the assumptions of MANAOVA, this data could potentially violates the noramlity and equal variance assumptions, and it is difficult for us to test these assumptions. </em></p>

<p><em>Since the original Review variable was extremly left skewed, the log transform was used on this variable. The intercept is the predicted value of Rating when review is 0 and the category is game. Reviews_log expalin a significant amount of variation in Rating, for every one log unit of review, there is an incrase in Rating that is less than 0.0001, on average. Being a category of medical would lead to a 0.105 increase in rating, on average, compared with game category. Being a category of sports would lead to a 0.085 increase in rating, on average, compared with game category.

<li><strong>6. (10 pts)</strong> Choose one variable you want to predict (can be one you used from before; either binary or continuous) and run a LASSO regression inputting all the rest of your variables as predictors. Choose lambda to give the simplest model whose accuracy is near that of the best (i.e., <code>lambda.1se</code>). Discuss which variables are retained. Perform 10-fold CV using this model: if response in binary, compare model’s out-of-sample accuracy to that of your logistic regression in part 5; if response is numeric, compare the residual standard error (at the bottom of the summary output, aka RMSE): lower is better fit!</li>
